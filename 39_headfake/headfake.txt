--------------------------------------------------
My Takeaways/Notes:
- Don't lose sight of inspirations and the ability to dream.
* Brick walls are there for a reason: they let us prove how badly we want things.
- Get the fundamentals down before trying any fancy stuff.
- Harsh feedback can mean that your critic sees your potential success.
* Be comfortable making mistakes and humbling yourself.
* Most of what we learn is learned indirectly (headfake).
  - Indirect learning can make something challenging fun to learn.
- Recognize success, but encourage further development (you're doing a disservice by setting the bar too low for your capabilities).
- The keys to success are freedom, communication, teamwork.
* You can learn something valuable from anyone, and you can teach something to anyone else.
- Be earnest and loyal; tell the truth; that's how you get people to help you.
* Listen to and use feedback.
