DISCO:
 - set() and get() methods that exist for list types can be used to push/pop stack values.
 - peekTop() can return a value directly stored in the list (at position _stackSize-1).


QCC:
 - Does Z refer to a generic type that we set ourselves?
 - Can an object take several generic types (ex <Integer, String>)?
