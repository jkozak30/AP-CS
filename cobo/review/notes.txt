1a. public static double sentimentVal(String word){}
1b. The method requires a String parameter. If you try to pass a different parameter, the program won't compile because it is required by the method.
1c. The method returns a double.

2. sentimentVal("hi") //1.25
   sentimentVal("great") //1.48
   sentimentVal("yes") //0.92

3a. It will compile, because sentimentVal will return a double that can be assigned as the value of a double variable.
3b. It will not compile, because sentimentVal will return a double, and this cannot be assigned to a String. Also, the method sentimentVal cannot take a double parameter
3c. It will not compile, because sentimentVal takes one parameter.
